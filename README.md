## IT IS AN ACADEMIC OFFENSE TO COPY CODE. THIS IS SIMPLY FOR REFERENCE

Working Code for ECE243 Lab 7 (Winter 2023) at the University of Toronto. The main code is in Verilog and can be simulated in Modelsim. The goal is to create a simple processor that implments the following instructions:

The processor reads the instructions to execute from the .mif file. Please see the attached PDF for more information. A schematic of how the processor works is as follows:
